The program will start after we run `go run .` in the terminal, after that it will ask our personal information from first name, last name, and email address. After we filled all the personal information it will ask us how many tickets do we want to purchase. At last the program will wait for 50 seconds then send a notification showing that it is successfully sent to our email.
